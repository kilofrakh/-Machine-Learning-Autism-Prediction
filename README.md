# Machine Learning Autism Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict autism based on various features. The dataset includes behavioral and demographic attributes that help in early autism detection.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of:
- Behavioral screening data
- Demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.)
- Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scores

## Features
- **Supervised Learning Algorithms**: The model is trained using classification techniques.
- **Feature Engineering**: Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature selection.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are used to measure model performance.

## Installation & Requirements
To run this project locally, ensure you have the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kilofrakh/-Machine-Learning-Autism-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd -Machine-Learning-Autism-Prediction
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for training and evaluation.

## Model Performance
The model is evaluated using:
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC Curve**
- **Classification Report**

## Results
The trained model provides a reliable prediction of autism with high accuracy. Further improvements can be made using deep learning techniques.

## Future Work
- Integration of deep learning models
- Deployment as a web-based prediction tool
